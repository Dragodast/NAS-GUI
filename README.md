# NAS-GUI for Raspberry PI 3b+ NAS

This is the GUI that I made for RPI3 B+ for my matriculation project. 
The GUI is quite outdated. I don't know when I get to this project again so, I'm making it open and free for use. 

The parts that I used:
- TFT Display 3,5"
- 12V DC Adapter
- Suptronics X820 V3.0 for connecting HDD to RPI
- Suptronics X715 power board for 12V pin for 3,5" HDDs and 5V for 2,5"
- The case for it is 3D printed.
